# etch-a-sketch

[LIVE PREVIEW](https://denvercowan.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

This project is part of the odin foundations course, It took quite a bit of extra research outside of what they teach you to be able to do this project but I think it turned out alright.

## Things I learned from this project

- GIT branching can be a real life saver if you need to refactor your code but do not want to mess up what you already have
- How to generate random RGB colors
- A little bit of CSS grid, and some additional CSS attributes

## Future plans

- I would like to add a reset button so that the user doesn't have to reload the page to clear their sketch once they want to start a new one
- I need to fix the box shadowing on the left eventually as well
